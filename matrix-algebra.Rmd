# motivating Eamples 

## Falling objects
```{r}
set.seed(1)
g <- 9.8
n <- 25
tt <- seq(0,3.4,len=n)
d <- 56.67 - 0.5*g*tt*2 + rnorm(n,sd=1)
plot(tt,d,ylab="Distance in meters",xlab="Time in seconds")
```
By looking at the plot one can deduce that the position should follow a parabola. We can model by - 

$$ Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \beta_2 x_{i}^{2} + \epsilon, i = 1......n $$

## Father and son heights 
```{r}
library(UsingR)
x = father.son$fheight
y = father.son$sheight
plot(x,y,xlab="Father's height", ylab="Son's height")
```
The son's height do seem to increase linearly with father's heights. In this case we chose a linear model - 

$$ Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \epsilon, i = 1,......,N $$
